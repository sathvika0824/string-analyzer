# String Analyzer 🧵

## 📌 Description

String Analyzer is a beginner-friendly Python mini project that performs common string operations such as reversing a string, checking palindromes, validating palindromes by ignoring special characters, and reversing words in a sentence.

This project is built to strengthen fundamental programming concepts and practice logic learned from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## ▶️ Sample Usage

python
reverse_string("hello")
# Output: "olleh"

is_palindrome("madam")
# Output: True

is_valid_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama")
# Output: True

reverse_words("hello world")
# Output: "world hello"

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand how to:

* Work with strings in Python
* Apply basic DSA logic in real code
* Build confidence by converting LeetCode problems into a practical project

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

* Add a menu-based CLI interface
* Add more string-related features
* Improve user interaction

> *"Small steps done consistently lead to big growth."*
